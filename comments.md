## Your Code Looks Fantastic!

Your data retrieval approach is both efficient and well-structured. Your work demonstrates a clear understanding of which functions to use and when. Moreover, your charts look amazing. The charts are visually appealing and effectively convey your insights, making it easy to follow your thought process throughout the workflow.

 To take your code to the next level, you might consider leveraging functions to enhance its flexibility and reusability. Encapsulating your data retrieving and plotting logic within a dedicated function would allow users to input new datasets seamlessly and generate charts without modifying the core code. I also added Markdowns to your `Jupyter Notebook` as comments to further explain what I'm trying to say. 

 Overall, your work is **excellent**, **clean**, **well-organized**, and **highly readable**. With these minor enhancements, it has the potential to be truly exceptional!
